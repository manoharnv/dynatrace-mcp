# @dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-mcp-server

## Unreleased Changes

### Tools

- `find_entities_by_name` now uses `smartscapeNode` DQL command under the hood, and will fall back to `fetch dt.entity.${entityType}`.

### Scopes

- Added OAuth scope `storage:smartscape:read`

### Proxy Support

- Added support for system proxy configuration via environment variables (`https_proxy`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `http_proxy`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `no_proxy`, `NO_PROXY`)

## 0.7.0

**Highlights**
üîí Human approval for critical operations
